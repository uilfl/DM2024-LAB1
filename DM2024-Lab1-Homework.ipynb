    "1. First: do the **take home** exercises in the [DM2024-Lab1-Master](https://github.com/didiersalazar/DM2024-Lab1-Master.git). You may need to copy some cells from the Lab notebook to this notebook. __This part is worth 20% of your grade.__\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Second: follow the same process from the [DM2024-Lab1-Master](https://github.com/didiersalazar/DM2024-Lab1-Master.git) on **the new dataset**. You don't need to explain all details as we did (some **minimal comments** explaining your code are useful though).  __This part is worth 30% of your grade.__\n",
    "    - Download the [the new dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Senem/Nostalgic_Sentiment_Analysis_of_YouTube_Comments_Data). The dataset contains a `sentiment` and `comment` columns, with the sentiment labels being: 'nostalgia' and 'not nostalgia'. Read the specificiations of the dataset for background details. \n",
    "    - You are allowed to use and modify the `helper` functions in the folder of the first lab session (notice they may need modification) or create your own.\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Third: please attempt the following tasks on **the new dataset**. __This part is worth 30% of your grade.__\n",
    "    - Generate meaningful **new data visualizations**. Refer to online resources and the Data Mining textbook for inspiration and ideas. \n",
    "    - Generate **TF-IDF features** from the tokens of each text. This will generating a document matrix, however, the weights will be computed differently (using the TF-IDF value of each word per document as opposed to the word frequency). Refer to this Scikit-learn [guide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) .\n",
    "    - Implement a simple **Naive Bayes classifier** that automatically classifies the records into their categories. Use both the TF-IDF features and word frequency features to build two seperate classifiers. Note that for the TF-IDF features you might need to use other type of NB classifier different than the one in the Master Notebook. Comment on the differences.  Refer to this [article](https://hub.packtpub.com/implementing-3-naive-bayes-classifiers-in-scikit-learn/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fourth: In the lab, we applied each step really quickly just to illustrate how to work with your dataset. There are somethings that are not ideal or the most efficient/meaningful. Each dataset can be handled differently as well. What are those inefficent parts you noticed? How can you improve the Data preprocessing for these specific datasets? __This part is worth 10% of your grade.__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Fifth: It's hard for us to follow if your code is messy, so please **tidy up your notebook** and **add minimal comments where needed**. __This part is worth 10% of your grade.__\n",
